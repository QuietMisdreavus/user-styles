# misdreavus's user styles

this is a collection of user styles i've written. i've thrown them here so that i can sync them
between my computers (since Stylus's OneDrive integration is broken on Firefox `>_>`) and also so
that i can share them with anyone else.

these user styles were all written in (and for) [Stylus]. technically anything that can load UserCSS
can load them, but that's the extension i use.
