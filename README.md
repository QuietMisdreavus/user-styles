# misdreavus's user styles

this is a collection of user styles i've written. i've thrown them here so that i can sync them
between my computers (since Stylus's OneDrive integration is broken on Firefox `>_>`) and also so
that i can share them with anyone else.

these user styles were all written in (and for) [Stylus]. technically anything that can load UserCSS
can load them, but that's the extension i use.

[Mastodon/Glitch fix][glitch-css]: Removes excess blank div underneath the Mastodon web view. I'm
not sure if this only applies to my own Mastodon instance, but that's where it's scoped to. If you
want to apply this yourself and you *don't* have a squad.town account, copy and modify it to use
your own instance domain.

[Narrower Wikipedia][wikipedia-css]: Narrows the article content of Wikipedia.
